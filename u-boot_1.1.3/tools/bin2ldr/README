How it is used:
	
	1. build the u-boot package first.
	2. a macro "APP_ENTRY" in the "bin2ldr.h" defines where the u-boot
	   will be loaded. Modify this macro to fit for your target board.
	3. a macro "BFIN_BOOT_MODE" in the "bin2ldr.h" defines the boot mode
           of your target board. The default mode is BF5XX_SPI_BOOT.
	4. strongly recommend running "runme.sh" to get the LDR format file
	5. file description:
		app.bin:  the original u-boot.bin
		app.ldr:  the binary LDR format file.
		app.hex:  the HEX LDR format file
 
The package and these notes were written rather hastily.
