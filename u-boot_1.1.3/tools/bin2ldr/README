This package converts u-boot binary file to LDR format file
for Blackfin BF53x to boot.

Now this package is only for SPI boot and has been tested on 
BF533 stamp board.

How it is used:
	
	1. build the u-boot package first.
	2. a macro "APP_ENTRY" in the "bin2ldr.h" defines where the u-boot
	   will be loaded. Modify this macro to fit for your target board.
	3. strongly recommend running "runme.sh" to get the LDR format file
	4. file description:
		app.bin:  the original u-boot.bin
		app.ldr:  the binary LDR format file.
		app.hex:  the HEX LDR format file
 
The package and these notes were written rather hastily.
